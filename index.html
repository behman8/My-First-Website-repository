            <p>'Hello, thank you for coming to my personal website! I am an online student at Flatiron and I am studying to become a software engineer. A little about myself is I live in Colorado, I enjoy hiking, I train in CrossFit, play Xbox to relax, and a beginner at drumming. I look forward to working on being the best software engineer I can be, and the process of it all!'</p>
